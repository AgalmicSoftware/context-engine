# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 2026-04-19

### Completed TODOs

- Made the local historical-avatar asset set canonical for demo personas, removed tracked placeholder avatar sentinel strings from the historical figure manifests and demo fixtures, rewrote avatar-source tests to ban placeholder-style sentinels and unapproved hotlinks, cleaned up planning-backed inline TODO comments in `SessionWizard` / `SingleQuestionResponse`, and removed the remaining `sponsoredSbtAddress` compatibility reads so `sponsored.gates` is the only canonical sponsored-SBT shape.

## 2026-04-17

### Completed TODOs

- Pinned `client` devDependency `typescript` to exactly `5.8.3` to match `@lit-protocol/contracts@0.9.1`'s strict peer, and adopted `--legacy-peer-deps` as the durable client install contract via `client/.npmrc` so `npm install` / `npm ci` no longer require the flag at the CLI. Strict restoration of plain `npm install` at the dep-graph level is deferred to the Phase 2 toolchain decision to move off `react-scripts@4` / CRA.

## 2026-04-16

### Completed TODOs

- Taught the shared client read-provider resolver to normalize browser-visible session RPC fields (`rpcUrlsByChainId`, `rpcEndpoint`, `rpcUrl`) alongside legacy `rpc.providers.path.*` overrides, so participant-facing session reads can use session-sponsored RPC directly when the on-chain `rpc` gate is open or the current wallet already has a cached grant, while restricted/unverified cases still fail closed onto the normal fallback stack; added focused regression coverage for worker-only, open, granted, and denied session-RPC selection paths.

## 2026-04-15

### Completed TODOs

- Strengthened crawler-visible discovery by adding a raw-HTML `noscript` summary to `client/public/index.html`, linking the canonical GitHub repo plus the live `main` branch source tree, adding a static `discoverability.html` summary page and `llms.txt`, limiting the sitemap to raw-HTML crawlable pages, and adding tests/docs so the public discovery links stay in sync.

## 2026-04-14

### Completed TODOs

- Stopped tracking generated worker bundle artifacts in `dist/`, updated CI and release verification to rebuild bundles before verifying them, removed the client-served `/worker/sessionCorsWorker.bundle.js` fallback path so normal and sponsored deploy flows now use the hosted GitHub release asset by default while still allowing one-off manual bundle URL or upload overrides after a fetch failure, explicitly marked automated worker-bundle GitHub releases as latest so the client's `releases/latest/download/...` URL stays current, refreshed Session Wizard fallback copy to explain the retry options, and updated docs/tests to treat `dist/*.bundle.js` as generated local fallback output rather than committed repo state.
- Added JSON-LD structured data for the public site so search engines can associate `contextengine.xyz` with the public GitHub repository via `sameAs`, while keeping the structured data synced with SPA route changes.
- Updated the public metadata description to align more closely with the README framing around AI-enhanced deliberation, large-group sensemaking, permanent records, and cryptographic access control.

## 2026-04-13

### Completed TODOs

- Strengthened root-site discovery metadata by updating the SPA shell title/description/canonical/social tags, added static `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` crawl assets, pointed root and client `homepage` metadata at `https://contextengine.xyz/`, refreshed the README opening section with stronger public framing and key links, and verified the client build copies the crawl assets into `client/build/`.

## 2026-04-06

### Completed TODOs

- Removed unused client dependencies `react-copy-to-clipboard`, `react-iframe`, `react-moment`, `fetchival`, `html-react-parser`, `papaparse`, `react-tooltip`, and `request`; regenerated `client/package-lock.json`; verified the production client build on Node 20.
- Removed unused client dependencies `axios`, `react-markdown`, `react-chartjs-2`, `chart.js`, `lucide-react`, and `moment`; removed dev dependencies `imagemin-cli` and `redux-devtools-extension`; replaced `classnames`, `react-hot-toast`, `react-datepicker`, and `idb-keyval` with repo-owned client code; regenerated `client/package-lock.json`; verified targeted tests locally and the production client build on Node 16; plain Node 20 `npm run build` still hits the repo's existing Webpack/OpenSSL incompatibility.

### Remaining TODOs

- Outstanding: complete the higher-risk peer-dependency cleanup still needed for clean no-flags `cd client && npm install`, especially `react-rangeslider`, `react-select`, and `reactstrap`.
