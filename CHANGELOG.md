### Completed TODOs

- PRD 396: strengthened root-site discovery metadata by updating the SPA shell title/description/canonical/social tags, added static `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` crawl assets, pointed root and client `homepage` metadata at `https://contextengine.xyz/`, refreshed the README opening section with stronger public framing and key links, and verified the client build copies the crawl assets into `client/build/`.

### Completed TODOs

- PRD 383: removed unused client dependencies `react-copy-to-clipboard`, `react-iframe`, `react-moment`, `fetchival`, `html-react-parser`, `papaparse`, `react-tooltip`, and `request`; regenerated `client/package-lock.json`; verified the production client build on Node 20.
- PRD 385: removed unused client dependencies `axios`, `react-markdown`, `react-chartjs-2`, `chart.js`, `lucide-react`, and `moment`; removed dev dependencies `imagemin-cli` and `redux-devtools-extension`; replaced `classnames`, `react-hot-toast`, `react-datepicker`, and `idb-keyval` with repo-owned client code; regenerated `client/package-lock.json`; verified targeted tests locally and the production client build on Node 16; plain Node 20 `npm run build` still hits the repo's existing Webpack/OpenSSL incompatibility.

### Remaining TODOs

- PRD 378 / PRD 382: complete the higher-risk peer-dependency cleanup still needed for clean no-flags `cd client && npm install`, especially `react-rangeslider`, `react-select`, and `reactstrap`.
